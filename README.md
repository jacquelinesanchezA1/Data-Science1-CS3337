Machine Learning focused!

Day 1 (06 03 24) Brief intro to what is Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence! 
Some Topics: 
  - Big Data!
  - What is learning? Gaining knowledge from data and learning from experience after multiple repetition. 
  - Data Science and a brief intro to all the components that data go through before being used. (pre-processing etc)
  - Machine Learning and its multiple learning techniques
  - Deep Learning and its Neural Network
  - Artificial Intelligence and the use of Big Data!

Day 2 (06 04 24) Brief intro to the two types of overall learning technique, supervised and unsupervised learning! The process behind building a model and all its attributes that goes behind building it! 
  Some Topics: 
    - Supervised Learning Techniques: Learning based on data that contains labels.  
        - Classification
        - Regressional 

    - Unsupervised Learning Techniques: Data that does not have any labels. Learning is based more in attributes of the data.
